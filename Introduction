The open source data is located at: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/DSDR/studies/21600
For this analysis we used Wave 1 and Wave 2 collections

We compiled the information using R (Located in the R Code Tab).
The rational, importance, and explination of the model and its implications are included in the document named 'Place Holder' locaded on the main page.
